## üîß Database Migration Required

### Step 1: Run the Migration
You need to add the `customer_name` column to your existing bookings table.

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- Add customer_name column to bookings table
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_name TEXT;

-- Update existing records with a default value
UPDATE bookings SET customer_name = 'Anonymous Customer' WHERE customer_name IS NULL;

-- Make the column required for new records
ALTER TABLE bookings ALTER COLUMN customer_name SET NOT NULL;

-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bookings_customer_name ON bookings(customer_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bookings_date ON bookings(date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bookings_date_time ON bookings(date, time_slot);
```

4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

**Option B: Using Migration File**
The migration is also available in: `supabase/migrations/20250523_add_customer_name.sql`

### Step 2: Verify the Migration
After running the migration, verify it worked:

```sql
-- Check if the column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings' AND column_name = 'customer_name';

-- Check existing data
SELECT id, customer_name, date, time_slot, total_cost 
FROM bookings 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
